# On-site Operations

This page answers questions about "things you'll encounter on-site," such as: how to display payment QR codes, how to settle orders, notification sounds, and multi-device collaboration.

## How do I set up payment QR codes? Does it support multiple payment channels?

In "Event Management," click "Edit" to upload an image.  
If you support both WeChat Pay and Alipay, you can **combine the two QR codes into one long image** and upload it (the easiest way).

## Does the system automatically complete orders after a customer pays?

**No.**  
To protect privacy and avoid financial risks, TanBox does not integrate with payment gateways.

After you hear the "Alipay/WeChat payment received" notification, you need to manually tap **"Complete Order"** on the vendor's phone to deduct inventory.

## Is there a sound notification for new orders?

**Yes.** The vendor's phone will play a notification sound when a new order request is received.

If you don't hear it, first check:

- Whether the phone is on **Silent/Do Not Disturb** mode
- Whether the **Media Volume** is too low

## Can multiple people / multiple devices run the stall simultaneously?

Yes! As long as they are connected to the same hotspot, you can:

- Set up 2 tablets as "ordering devices"
- Have 3 vendors use their phones as "fulfillment devices"

All data syncs in real-time.
