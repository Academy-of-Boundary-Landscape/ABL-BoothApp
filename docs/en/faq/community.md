# Community & Open Source

This section primarily covers: download channels, update methods, feedback channels, and common questions related to open source.

## Where can I download the latest version?

Please use the only official channel: the **GitHub Releases** page.  
Any channel that requires payment for download or charges for "deployment services" is fraudulent. Please do not fall for it.

## Can I update automatically?

Please click the "Check for Updates" button in the sidebar. The system will automatically detect the latest version and guide you to download the installer.  
The current version does not support one-click automatic updates; you need to manually download the installer and perform an overwrite installation.

## Where should I report bugs or suggestions?

- **Program errors**: It is highly recommended to submit an **Issue** on the GitHub repository (makes it easier for developers to track and fix).
- **Usage questions/Casual chat**: Welcome to join the **User Discussion Group**.

## I'm a developer. Can I contribute code to the project?

**Absolutely welcome!**  
Whether it's fixing a small bug or developing a new feature module, your contributions will help more stall owners.  
Welcome to submit a **Pull Request**.

## Can I modify the software and redistribute (or even sell) it?

This project follows the **MIT License**. You do have the freedom to modify and distribute it.  
However, as a free tool aimed at "lowering the barrier for fan creators to set up stalls," we **strongly discourage** packaging and selling it as commercial software.

Please retain the original author information and respect the spirit of open source.
