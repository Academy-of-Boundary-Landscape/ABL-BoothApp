# Hardware Recommendations

In short: Tanhe doesn't have high performance requirements, but it has high demands for "continuous online" operation, so the choice of host device is crucial.

## Can I run the host client on a mobile phone?

Technically yes, but **strongly not recommended**.

The reasons are practical:

- Screen lock/background processes are easily killed
- Overheating can cause throttling or even disconnection
- On-site, you'll still need to use it for payments/communication, making misoperations likely

**It is recommended to use a laptop or tablet as the host device.**

## Are there performance requirements for the device?

Requirements are very low:

- Any Windows PC capable of running the latest version of Chrome/Edge
- Or a tablet/phone with Android 8.0+

can run it smoothly. Using older devices as "customer ordering terminals" is also a great way to repurpose them.

## Does the screen need to stay on all the time?

- The host client is recommended to keep the screen on, or set **"Never Sleep"** in the power settings
- Customer-side tablets are recommended to set **"Screen Always On"** to avoid the screen suddenly going black during customer ordering.
