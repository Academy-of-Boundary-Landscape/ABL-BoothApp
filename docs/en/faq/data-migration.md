# Data Security and Migration

This page covers three main concerns: where your data is stored, how to transfer it to a new device, and what's included in the exported Excel file.

## Where is my data stored? Is it secure?

All data (images, ledgers, inventory) is stored in the **local database on your host device**.  
We do not have any cloud servers. No one except you has access to your sales data.

## How do I migrate data to a new device?

On the "Global Product Library" page, click **"Export Data Package"**. This will download a package containing all product information and images.  
Send this file to your new device, then go to the Settings page and select **"Import Data"**.

## What's included in the exported Excel file?

It includes an exhibition overview and the key **Product Sales Statistics Table**.  
You can directly send this table to the event organizer to submit your report (it's really convenient).
