# Image Display

Images are crucial for "whether customers are willing to place an order," but they are also the most likely to be hindered by the original file size.

## Product images won't display or load very slowly?

Follow this sequence:

1. Check if the image filename contains special characters (it is recommended to use **only numbers or English letters** for naming).
2. The local network transmission bandwidth is limited. It is recommended to compress a single image to **within 500KB**.  
   Do not directly upload a 10MB high-definition original image (it will be very painful on-site).

## Can I customize the interface style?

Currently, for convenience, only customizing light/dark mode and theme colors is supported.  
More detailed theme customization features will be available in the future.
